# Summary

Many branches of astronomy interpret observations through approximate,
one-dimensional models of stars.  Furthermore, many stars are observed
to undergo resonant pulsations, and the frequencies at which they do
so are similarly interpreted through the predicted pulsations of the
one-dimensional models.  Since the problem was defined in its modern
form around the mid-20th century, many programs have been written to
produce models and predict their frequencies and correspondingly many
custom data formats have been defined, with varying levels of ease-of-use
and interoperability.  Some are fixed-width plain text files; some are
Fortran binaries; some can be converted from one format to another
(but not necessarily back again).

`tomso` is a set of Python modules that provides a high-level
interface to several formats and enables or simplifies several common
tasks in analysing the stellar models and oscillations.  First, it can
be convenient—and in some cases necessary—to convert files between
different formats.  Some routines might be provided but new routines
can be generated by extending `tomso`'s machinery.  Second, some
experiments require involve modifying the stellar models directly,
which requires reading the file in the correct format, manipulating
the data, then making sure that the data is re-written in the same
(potentially fixed) format.  Finally, the high-level interface allows
convenient access to sometimes complicated properties that can be
derived from the data.

For example, two derived properties are the speed of sound
$c_\mathrm{s}$ and acoustic depth $\tau$, which is how long a sound
wave would take to travel from a star's surface to some depth inside.
The sound speed gradient $dc_\mathrm{s}/d\tau$ is useful for
identifying regions where sudden changes in the star's structure might
discernibly affect the frequencies at which it vibrates.
Such a figure is shown for a standard solar model, Model S [@modelS],
in the textbook by @acdk2010 [their Fig. 7.30, which is in essence the
same as Fig. 1 in @monteiro2000] but requires some manipulation of the
source data because neither $c_\mathrm{s}$ nor $\tau$ are part of the
data format.  Fig. \autoref{fig:dc_dtau} shows the same data but with
`tomso` this is naturally expressed in two lines of Python code: one
to read the data file and one to plot the relevant data using the
high-level properties `cs` and `tau`.

`tomso`'s interfaces also aim to be easily extensible, so that in the
future it can not only support more current codes and file formats,
but also those that have yet to be developed.
