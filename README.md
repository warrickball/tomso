# TOMSO: Tools for Modelling Stars and their Oscillations

TOMSO is a set of Python modules for loading and saving input and
output files for and from stellar evolution and oscillation
codes.  Functions are presently implemented for

* [MESA](http://mesa.sourceforge.net)
* [STARS](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~stars)
* ADIPLS
* [GYRE](https://bitbucket.org/rhdtownsend/gyre/wiki/Home)

Documentation is available on
[ReadTheDocs.org](http://tomso.readthedocs.io).  Beware that the code
is *very unstable*.  Expect the API to change drastically or
completely without warning!
