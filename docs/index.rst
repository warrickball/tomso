``tomso`` is a set of Python modules for loading and saving input and
output files for and from stellar evolution and oscillation codes.
The functions are bundled together in modules that correspond to a
specific stellar evolution code, stellar oscillation code or file
format.  ``tomso`` currently supports the
`FGONG <http://www.astro.up.pt/corot/ntools/docs/CoRoT_ESTA_Files.pdf>`_
format and various input/output files for
`ADIPLS <https://phys.au.dk/~jcd/adipack.v0_3/>`_,
`GYRE <https://gyre.readthedocs.io/>`_,
`MESA <https://docs.mesastar.org>`_ and
`STARS <https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~stars>`_.

The code is intended to be the minimum necessary to usefully
manipulate input and output data.  The only current requirement is
*NumPy*.  *Matplotlib* is optional and only required for the command-line plotter.

Installation
------------

You can install most recent stable(ish) version of ``tomso`` from the
`Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ using::

  pip3 install tomso

perhaps with the ``--user`` flag, depending how you administer your
system and with ``-U`` or ``--upgrade`` to upgrade from a previous
version.

The `development version <https://github.com/warrickball/tomso>`_ is
on GitHub.  The repo also includes unit tests and test data, which I
try to omit from the PyPI package to keep it small.  The tests are
written using `unittest <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html>`_
and must be run from the `tests` directory.  I usually run the tests using
`pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`_ with::

  cd tests
  pytest

but you can run them as standalone Python scripts with, e.g.::

  ls test_*.py | xargs -n1 python3

The tests retrieve some online data to check that we can read from
URLs.  These will fail if you're offline or run slowly if your
internet connection is slow.

Basic usage
-----------

``tomso`` provides a straightforward interface for multiple tasks on
stellar models.

For a simple real-world example, to convert an FGONG file (that
doesn't have *G* in the header) to an ADIPLS binary stellar model
file, use::

  from tomso import fgong
  m = fgong.load_fgong('model.fgong', G=6.67430e-8)
  a = m.to_amdl()
  a.to_file('model.amdl')

You can also use the command-line interface:::

  tomso convert model.fgong -o model.amdl -G 6.67430e-8

The object-oriented interface makes plotting easier.  Here's
Fig. (7.30) of Aerts, Christensen-Dalsgaard & Kurtz (2010):

.. plot::
   :include-source:

   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
   from tomso import fgong

   S = fgong.load_fgong('https://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/solar_models/fgong.l5bi.d.15c', G=6.67232e-8)
   pl.plot(S.tau, np.gradient(S.cs, S.tau)/1e4)
   pl.xlabel("τ (sec)")
   pl.ylabel("dc/dτ (10⁴ cm/s²)")
   pl.axis([100., 3000., 0., 2.5])

The command-line interface also allows you to make some quick look
plots, like a propagation diagram for Model S: ::

  tomso plot "https://users-phys.au.dk/jcd/solar_models/fgong.l5bi.d.15c" -G 6.67232e-8 -x x -y N S_1 --legend auto --scale-y 0.1591549e3 --plotter semilogy --axhline 5.2 --xlabel "r/R" --ylabel "frequency (mHz)"

where the ``--scale-factor`` multiplies the angular frequencies by
1000/2π.

.. plot::

   from tomso import cli
   args = cli.get_parser().parse_args("plot ../tests/data/modelS.fgong -G 6.67232e-8 -x x -y N S_1 --legend auto --scale-y 0.1591549e3 --plotter semilogy --axhline 5.2 --xlabel r/R --ylabel frequency (mHz)".split())
   args.func(args)

The code is described in more detail through the links in the
*user guide*.  The *module APIs* list all available functions.

Something isn't working
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Search
`the issues <https://github.com/warrickball/tomso/issues?q=is%3Aissue>`_
on GitHub and, if your problem hasn't been addressed before, open a
new issue that describes what you tried to do, what you expected to
happen and what happened instead.  In case it's helpful, include your
operating system, Python version and NumPy version.  Also try to
include a
`minimal working example <https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example>`_,
including the files (or parts thereof) that are causing the problem.

I found a bug and wrote a patch to fix it
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you've found the problem is something in ``tomso`` that doesn't work as it
should and fixed it yourself, great!  Open a
`pull request <https://github.com/warrickball/tomso/pulls>`_
that describes what the problem was and how your patch fixes it.

I want ``tomso`` to support my favourite file format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open an issue with links to the specification of the file format or
where I can find (or create) examples with which to test new code.  I
have limited time to extend ``tomso``'s features unless it happens to
align with research I'm doing but I'll try my best to implement
something.

  how to read Fortran binary files in Python, without which most of
  the ADIPLS module would be impossible.
